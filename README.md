Collectables uses 2 release channels, full and beta.

The full version is a proper release which isn't an unstable pre-release. Full versions are not released as frequently as beta versions, but updating from one full version to another typically contains much more content at once, compaired to what would be between beta releases.

Beta versions are released more frequently and are unstable.
